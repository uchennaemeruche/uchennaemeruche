## :zap: About Me

I am a human being and a Software Engineer, passionate about writing quality and maintainable code while building digital products at scale.

I offer years of proven experience in building highly scalable software solutions in a CI/CD-based and test-driven environment. Having worked(still working) as a Software Engineer at different levels over the years, I bring to bear robust and multifarious problem-solving techniques as well as expertise in building reliable and maintainable softwares using both Frontend and Backend tools.

I am detail-oriented, a self-starter, a fast and passionate learner, an excellent verbal and written communicator and a team-player/manager with good interpersonal and analytical skills. 

I love simplicity, keeping things DRY, eating Afang soup and to travel the world to meet new people and experience new things. I'm fluent in English

Recently, I have been more actively involved in building and managing scalable APIs and integrating with 3rd party services.
